## Registering a New Account

To initiate the registration process, locate and click the Sign Up button. 
Input a valid work email address, choose a unique password that meets Syro’s 
password requirements, and agree to Syro's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. 
Following these steps, you'll be asked to download and securely store your 
Account Recovery Kit. Next, new users will then be guided to input their first 
and last names, as well as their company's name (unless they're joining an already 
established organization). Upon completion of these steps, your registration is 
finalized and you can begin using Syro!

## Securely Storing Your Account Recovery Kit

The Account Recovery Kit houses your email address and Secret Key in a plain text format. 
This Secret Key is a random alphanumeric password, autonomously generated by the Syro 
application during account creation. It's vital to comprehend the importance and sensitivity 
of your Secret Key. Losing access to it can lead to severe difficulties in recovering your account, 
and in many situations, it may make account recovery **impossible**.

Syro strongly advises saving your Account Recovery Kit on a USB flash drive or printing it out and 
securing it in a safe location, such as a safe deposit box. Properly storing your Account Recovery 
Kit will ensure your account’s safety and that you can reset your password or regain access to your 
account when necessary. Please note, Syro does not have knowledge of your Secret Key and will never 
ask for it.


## Account Recovery

Your password, unlike the Secret Key, should be a secure yet memorable passphrase that you will 
frequently use to access your account. However, in the unlikely event that you forget or want to 
reset your password, navigate to the Syro login page and press Forgot Password. Next, enter the email 
address associated with your account. You will receive an email with a reset password link,  click on 
Set a New Password. From there, enter your Private Key (from your Account Recovery Kit) and new Password 
to reset your password.
