In Syro, handling secrets is straightforward and uniform, designed to ensure simplicity and consistency across all levels - be it at the Project or Sub-Project level. This guide provides you with a walkthrough on creating, adding, and managing secrets efficiently using Syro.

### Adding Secrets

There are several ways to add secrets to a project:

- Via integrations with third-party cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure
- By uploading a .env file to a specific project
- By manually adding the key-value pair

### Via Integration

To add secrets via integration, please refer to the **[Integrations documentation](https://www.notion.so/2624f9d256874de8aceba7456264d6c8?pvs=21)**.

### Via .env file

To add secrets via upload an .env file, on the “secrets” tab within your desired project, select “**Upload .env.**”

Choose the local .env file containing the secrets related to your project and press “Open.”

You will be shown a preview of the secrets you're uploading.

Press “Save” to commit the uploaded secrets to your project.

### Via Manual Upload

To add a secret to your Project or Sub-Project, press “Add Secret.”

<img height="200" src="/images/add-secret.png" />

Input the secret Key and Value and press “Add Secret.” You can also add notes for that specific key-value pair and set a rotation reminder. The rotation reminder triggers an email at the set interval, reminding you to rotate the secret.

<img height="200" src="/images/add-reminder.png" />

Press “Save” to commit the secret to your project.
<img height="200" src="/images/save-reminder.png" />

The successful commit of the secret will be confirmed.

### Via the CLI

To add a secret via Syro’s CLI Integration, refer to the CLI Usage documentation [here](https://www.notion.so/b0b09113be574081bf6f8852ad4bbf2e?pvs=21). 

### Deleting a Secret

Click "Remove" for each secret you wish to delete. You can select multiple secrets simultaneously. To confirm the deletion, press "Save.”

*Note: Deleting a secret is a permanent action and cannot be undone. This operation will eliminate the secret wherever it is used.*
