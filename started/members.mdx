### Overview

To add a user to a specific project, it's crucial to first add them to your organization. Once the user is added, you can add them to any project or sub-project. Please note, simply adding them to your organization doesn't grant them access to any secrets. Specific permissions for accessing secrets must be expressly granted by you.

### **Adding a Member to your Organization**

To add a user to your organization:

1. Navigate to the "**Settings**" page.
2. Click "**Invite Team Member**".

Enter the user's first name, last name, and email address.

Once a user is added, they will receive an invite email notifying them. Once accepted, they will be a member of your organization.

### Managing Invites

Once the invite is sent, you have the option to either resend the invite if the new user has not accepted the invite, or remove the user.

### Adding a User to a Project

To add a user to a project:

1. Navigate to the "**Settings**" page within your project.
2. Press "**Add**".

A list of your organization's users will be displayed. From this list, select the user you want to add to your project.

*Note: To add a user to a project, you must first add them to your organization. The new user must accept the invitation and set up their account. To invite a new user, navigate to the “**Settings**” tab on the navigation bar and follow the steps above.*

To remove a user from a specific project, click on the “**Remove**” button and confirm removal. This will revoke the removed user's access to any of that project's secrets.

### Managing Access

If permissions are granted to the master project (in this illustrative example, the "**database**" project), the added user will have access to all of the nested projects and secrets. However, if the user is only added to a sub-project (for example, the "**billing_services**" project), they will not have access to any other sub-projects or the master project and its secrets.
