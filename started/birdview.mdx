### Intent

In Syro, the '**Secrets**' section plays a critical role in managing your app's secrets. Accessible from the side navigation bar, it provides a bird’s eye view of all secrets within your organization that you have access to. It also indicates where these secrets are stored. The purpose of this tab is to increase visibility into your organization's secrets on a global level.

### Navigating the Secrets Tab

The Secrets tab has three main columns: Key, Value, and Project.

1. The '**Key**' column displays your keys, using the nomenclature you have given them.

1. The '**Value**' column displays the values of the keys. These could be imported to Syro via integration, importing via .env file or added manually.

1. The '**Project**' column indicates the project or sub-project where a specific secret is stored. Clicking on a project name will directly take you to the specific location within the project or sub-project where the secret is stored, allowing for easy navigation and access.
