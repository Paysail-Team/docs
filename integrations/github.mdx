## Integrating GitHub

In this tutorial, you'll learn the steps to configure secrets for automatic two-way synchronization with GitHub. 

### **Prerequisites**

Before integrating GitHub with your secret manager, please ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Access to your GitHub account.
- Admin privileges for the repository with which you want to sync secrets.
- Familiarity with GitHub repositories, settings, and access controls.

Please make sure you have the necessary permissions and access to perform the required actions within GitHub. If you require assistance with managing permissions and access, refer to the **[GitHub documentation on managing access](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-access-to-your-projects)**.

### **Integration**

Select the **Project** or **Sub-Project** you would want to integrate with GitHub, navigate to the **Integrations** tab and select the **GitHub tile** to begin the authorization process.

If you have not previously integrated GitHub with a Syro Project or Sub-Project, you will see the following screen:

### ****Authorize Syro****

Grant Syro access to your GitHub account by signing into GitHub (this only allows for GitHub Repo privileges)

## **Start Integration**

Select which **GitHub repository secrets** you want to sync with your Syro Project or Sub-Project and press **Confirm** to start syncing secrets.

*******************Note: Integrating GitHub will not sync the key/value pair from GitHub; it will only sync the secret key (not the value of the key). An illustration of the difference is below:*******************

**Example: Key without Value** 

Key: ACME_API_KEY
Value: N/A

**Example: Key/Value Pair**

Key: ACME_API_KEY
Value: abcdef1234567890

Rest assured, once you have synced the secret keys from the repo of your choice, you can add the values to the key value pairs.

## **Adding Values**

Once the secret keys are synced, the values will appear as “N/A.”

To add a value before saving, start by pressing view to directly edit the secret. 

<img height="200" src="/images/adding-values-2.png" />

Next, enter the corresponding key’s value. 

<img height="200" src="/images/adding-values-3.png" />

Press “Confirm” to confirm the changes. 

<img height="200" src="/images/adding-values-4.png" />

Once you have entered values for each of the newly synced secrets, press “Save” to finalize and save the changes.

## ******************Adding Additional Repositories******************

To sync to an additional GitHub repository, you can integration an additional repository under the “Integrations” tab. The concurrent GitHub integrations will appear under the “Active integrations” tab.
