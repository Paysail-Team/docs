In this tutorial, you'll learn the steps to configure Syro secrets for automatic two-way synchronization with AWS Secrets Manager.

### Prerequisites

- You have AWS Console Access.
- You have AWS IAM Access.
    
    [Ability to create IAM roles and permissions](https://www.notion.so/Ability-to-create-IAM-roles-and-permissions-4fb57c8a65844e6aa89e9ed838558396?pvs=21)
    
    - Ability to access IAM users

If you have not previously integrated AWS Secrets Manager to your Syro Project or Sub-Project, you will see the following screen:

- **Access Key ID**: Part of the security credentials used to authenticate requests to AWS services, including the Secrets Manager.
- **Secret Access Key**: Part of your security credentials, similar to a password, which together with your Access Key ID, allows Syro to securely access Secrets Manager.
- **Region:** The AWS region where the cluster of data centers where the secrets you are pull into Syro are geographically located i.e. **us-east-1**

### **Authorize Syro**

To allow Syro to access Secrets Manager, you must obtain your AWS Access Key ID and Secret access key from your IAM user. You can do so by following this path on AWS:

**IAM > Users > User > Security credentials > Access keys** 

Press **Create access key**

From here, you can retrieve your **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key,** and paste them in the input boxes for Access Key ID and Secret Access Key respectively.
